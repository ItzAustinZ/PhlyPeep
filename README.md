PhlyPeep: Twitter clone for DPC 12 Workshop
===========================================

This is a sample module for the DPC 12 Zend Framework 2 workshop on building
re-usable modules. The goals are:

* Demonstrate some principles to follow when writing modules
* Demonstrate a number of components, including the ServiceManager, InputFilter,
  Form, MVC, and Db.

This will not and should not be considered a fully-functional, full-featured
module, though the basic functionality should work.
